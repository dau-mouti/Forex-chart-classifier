# Forex Chart Classification Using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (EfficientNet) to classify candlestick chart images into **Buy** or **Sell** signals.

##  Key Features
- CNN-based image classification
- Precision: 0.77 (Buy), 0.73 (Sell)
- Deployed as a web application
- Clean, labeled dataset with chart overlays (SMA, EMA)

##  Project Structure
- `/model/` - trained `.h5` model
- `/notebooks/` - training and testing notebooks
- `/images/` - sample charts, confusion matrix, UI screenshots

##  How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run notebook or UI script
