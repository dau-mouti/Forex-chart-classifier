# Forex Chart Classification Using CNN

A deep learning model for **Buy/Sell prediction** based on Forex candlestick chart images using **CNNs and Transfer Learning (ResNet50)**.

---

## Overview

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and transfer learning with ResNet50 to classify Forex chart images into **Buy** or **Sell** signals. It is deployed as a simple web app for real-time predictions.

---

##  Key Features

-  CNN-based image classification with ResNet50
-  Precision: **0.77 (Buy)**, **0.73 (Sell)**
-  Deployed as a web application (Gradio)
-  Uses candlestick charts with SMA & EMA overlays
-  Clean, labeled dataset (not included in repo)
